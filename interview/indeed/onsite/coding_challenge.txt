Given a log file, which contains some url strings for site visits:

...&ctk=abcdefg&ts=123456778&type=search&...

Basically, it has three components:

1. ctk: a key to identify the cookie
2. ts: timestamp
3. type: search of click

The problem asks to write a program to process a log file that contains multiple queries and output session info. A session is defined as:

A series of events (click or search) that has the same ctk with no time gaps > 15 mins.

The log file is ordered by timestamp.

Solution:

Maintain a hashmap to keep track of the session data and last timestamp of the session,
whenever a new event has time gap > 15mins of this session, we output the session and reset it.

The problem is that they limit the memory so the above solution will run out of memory.
I changed to map and passed the largest test, however the map has log(n) runtime.

The optimal solution should be flush out the content of the hashmap periodically, since some session
might have already expired (> 15mins) but the above procedure requires a new event with the same ctk
to kick it out of hashmap.
